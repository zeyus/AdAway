# ![AdAway logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdAway/AdAway/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/icon.png) AdAway fork for Android 4.1 to Android 13

This fork is to fix AdAway on older android versions but supports the latest Magisk systemless hosts method.

AdAway is an open source ad blocker for Android using the hosts file.

## Installing

There are two kinds of release:
* The preview builds: on the bleeding edge of development - for testers or adventurous
* The stable builds: ready for every day usage - for end users

### Requirements

Installing the application requires:
* Android 4.1 _Jelly Bean_ or above
* A **rooted device**

### Preview builds
For users with bugs, there may be preview builds available from the [XDA development thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753) or the related [Android File Host folder](https://androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=249276&sort_by=date&sort_dir=DESC).
It is recommended to try those builds to see if your issue is resolved before creating an issue.
The preview builds may contain bug fixes or new features for new android versions.
